# Python Utilities

These are small python tools that I made while learning how to automate computer tasks. 
Each script here solves problems like cleaning files, organizing folders, or converting dat formats. 

## Tools

1. clean_duplicates.py
   Removes duplicate files in a folder by comparing file names and sizes.

2. convert_logs.py
   Turns text log files into CSV format for easier reading and analysis.

3. system_health_monitor.py  
Checks CPU, memory, and disk space usage and saves a report to a log file.  
Made this while learning how to monitor system performance with Python.
